# djangoDelights



This is a short full stack project to get familiar with the django framwork. This is designed to be an 'inventory manager' albeit with limited functionality.
You can find two apps in the project, 'users' which keeps track of all the people who sign up and 'inventory' which focuses on providing functionality to create a menu as well as keep track of ingredients and purchases made.
